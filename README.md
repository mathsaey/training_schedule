# TrainingSchedule.ex

Self-hosted training planner (for runners).

The goal of this project is to replace spreadsheets as a means to put together
your personal training plan. Currently, it enables the creation of custom
workout types which can be planned on a calendar.

This project is very much in its infancy. While the groundwork is present for
some upcoming features, limited time means they may not land any time soon.

It was also a nice excuse for me to learn css fundamentals by playing
with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and to get used to developing web
applications with [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and Phoenix
LiveView. Since it is my first time working with both of these technologies,
you should not expect to see idiomatic Tailwind or LiveView code here.

## Features

- Create custom workout types
- Plan workouts and display them on a calendar

Under development:

- Multi-account support (Done, with the exception of a UI to add users)

## Ideas for future versions

- Share (parts of) your schedule publicly
- Integrate with strava, garmin connect, â€¦ to compare expected / actual mileage.
- Workout description / notes with markdown support
- Supplementary workouts (strength / stretches)
- Export calendar to (customisable) markdown for, e.g., writing race reports
- Create complete plans which can be added to the calendar with a single click
- Support for displaying additional information (e.g. focus of the current training block)
